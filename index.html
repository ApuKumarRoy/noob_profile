    <h3>My Favourite Anime:</h3>
    <p>
      Okay, I have watched many many animes for the last 2 or 3 years of my
      life. I started watching anime from 2020. In my earlier years I have
      watched Doraemon, Pokemon, Ninja Hatori, Kitretsu and many more anime but
      at that time I didn't know these are call anime. So apart from these, My
      first ever anime I've watched in 2020 was
      <strong><em>"One Punch Man"</em></strong
      >. I really enjoy this anime. It has 2 seasons and some ova. It's about a
      man who is a hero for fun that can one-shot every villain. Because of this
      massive power he didn't get to enjoy his fight with other villains as it
      all take was a one punch.
